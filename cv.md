### About me
Briefly. I try to constantly learn something new. With this desire, I came to this project. Thanks more to this team that they provide an opportunity to learn, to make the lives of individuals and society as a whole better. 

At the moment I am working as a layout designer in a small web studio in Kirov. 

The short term goal is to become a fronted development specialist. Medium-term goal - Full Stack. There is no specific long-term goal, because I donâ€™t know where the desire to learn new things can bring in the end. But my goal as a whole is to develop in the IT industry.

I don't smoke or drink. Spend most of your free time learning new things.
